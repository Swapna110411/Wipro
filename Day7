Your answer

import java.util.*;

public class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;
    double salary;
    String department;

    public Employee(int id, String name, double salary, String department) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.department = department;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "abc", 55000.00, "development");
        Employee e2 = new Employee(11, "xyz", 43500.00, "development");
        Employee e3 = new Employee(5, "fname", 100000.00, "production");
        Employee e4 = new Employee(21, "name123", 75000, "support");
        Employee e5 = new Employee(17, "someName", 85000, "development");

        ArrayList<Employee> empList = new ArrayList<>();
        empList.add(e1);
        empList.add(e2);
        empList.add(e3);
        empList.add(e4);
        empList.add(e5);

        // Calculate average salary for "development" department
        double sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (Employee emp : empList) {
            if (emp.getDepartment().equalsIgnoreCase("development")) {
                sum += emp.getSalary();
                count++;
            }
        }

        double avg = sum / count;
        System.out.println(avg);
    }
}
